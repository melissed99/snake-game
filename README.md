# snake-game
Final Project for CMPUT 274
Snake Game on Arduino

Team Members: Raymond Sarinas (1476504), Melisse Doroteo (1499913)

The Arduino and the display will be wired the exact same as how we did it
for Assignment 2.

Milestone 1:
- Draw and move around snake (prevent diagonal movement)
- Draw an apple.
- Draw startup and game-over screens.

Milestone 2:
- Randomize location of apple each time eaten.
- When snake eats apple, make snake longer.

Milestone 3:
- Endgame conditions if snake hits corner/edge of screen or hits itself.
- Draw and record score.
- After score of 5 or 10(?) increase snake movement (makes it more difficult)
