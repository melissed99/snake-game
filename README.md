Final Project for CMPUT 274
Snake Game on Arduino

Team Members: Raymond Sarinas (1476504), Melisse Doroteo (1499913)

The Arduino and the display will be wired the exact same as how we did it
for Assignment 2.

Milestone 1: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 28
- Draw and move around snake (prevent diagonal movement?) ✔️
- Draw an apple. ✔️
- Draw startup and game-over screens. ✔️

Milestone 2: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 29
- Randomize location of apple each time eaten. ✔️
- When snake eats apple, make snake longer. ✔️

Milestone 3: ✔️ COMPLETED DEC 1
- Endgame conditions if snake hits corner/edge of screen. ✔️
- Endgame conditions if snake hits itself. ✔️
- Draw and record score with new boundaries. ✔️
- Implement different levels of difficulty (i.e. varying snake speed)✔️

Milestone 4: TO BE COMPLETED DEC 6?
- Implement deque for snake movement(?) 😢
- Clean up code and add comments
- Make README

TO DO:
- implement deque for snake movement
- fix bug where apple could potentially be drawn underneath snake
- fix bug where apple just sometimes does not draw at all?
- flashing bug fixed (but not really)
- clean code / delete extra code, change variable names to make more sense
- add comments, make README
