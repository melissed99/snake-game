# snake-game
Final Project for CMPUT 274
Snake Game on Arduino

Team Members: Raymond Sarinas (1476504), Melisse Doroteo (1499913)

The Arduino and the display will be wired the exact same as how we did it
for Assignment 2.

Milestone 1: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 28
- Draw and move around snake (prevent diagonal movement?) ✔️
- Draw an apple. ✔️
- Draw startup and game-over screens. ✔️

Milestone 2: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 29
- Randomize location of apple each time eaten. ✔️
- When snake eats apple, make snake longer. ✔️

Milestone 3:
- Endgame conditions if snake hits corner/edge of screen. ✔️
- Endgame conditions if snake hits itself.
- Draw and record score. ✔️
- After score of 5 or 10(?) increase snake movement (makes it more difficult)

Milestone 4:
- Implement deque for snake movement(?)
- Clean up code and add comments
- Make README

TO DO:
- display score on screen and change display boundaries for where snake can go AND
  where apples are drawn
- change speed every 5 apples eaten
- endgame condition where snake runs into itself (thing Raymond did does not work tragically)
- implement deque for snake movement
- clean code / delete extra code
- add comments, make README
