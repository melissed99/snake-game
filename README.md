Team Members: Raymond Sarinas (1476504), Melisse Doroteo (1499913)

The Arduino and the display will be wired the exact same as how we did it
for Assignment 2.

Milestone 1: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 28
- Draw and move around snake (prevent diagonal movement?) ✔️
- Draw an apple. ✔️
- Draw startup and game-over screens. ✔️

Milestone 2: ✔️ COMPLETED NOV 29
- Randomize location of apple each time eaten. ✔️
- When snake eats apple, make snake longer. ✔️

Milestone 3: ✔️ COMPLETED DEC 1
- Endgame conditions if snake hits corner/edge of screen. ✔️
- Endgame conditions if snake hits itself. ✔️
- Draw and record score with new boundaries. ✔️
- Implement different levels of difficulty (i.e. varying snake speed)✔️

Milestone 4:
- Implement deque for snake movement(?)
- Clean up code and add comments
- Make README

TO DO:
  - WAIT IT WORKS BUT ONLY AFTER RESETING/PLAYING SECOND GAME DOES THE DOT GLITCH THING
- implement deque for snake movement
- clean code / delete extra code, change variable names to make more sense
- add comments, make README
